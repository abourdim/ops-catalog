    wiki_history: 'Claude Shannon founded information theory in 1948, establishing the mathematical framework for signal transmission and proving fundamental capacity limits. Cognitive Ew builds on this foundation, letting you explore these historical concepts through interactive simulation.',
    wiki_math_title: '📐 Mathematics Behind Rfw Cognitive Ew',
    wiki_math: 'The mathematics behind Cognitive Ew: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB = 10·log₁₀(Psignal/Pnoise). Every 3 dB increase doubles the signal power relative to noise. QAM-256 encodes 8 bits per symbol using 256 amplitude/phase combinations. Higher-order modulation increases throughput but requires better SNR. Wavelength λ = c/f where c = 3×10⁸ m/s. A 2.4 GHz signal has λ = 12.5 cm. Antenna size is typically λ/4 to λ/2.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced exploit development practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',
    wiki_compare_title: '⚖️ Comparing Approaches',
    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to exploit development. Hardware-based solutions using browser offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with exploit development: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in exploit development.',
    wiki_ethics_title: '⚖️ Ethics & Legal Considerations',
    wiki_ethics: 'Exploit Development carries important ethical and legal responsibilities. Many countries regulate the use of browser and similar equipment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own. Respect privacy laws and data protection regulations. This simulation is designed for educational purposes — it demonstrates principles without transmitting real signals or accessing real networks. Responsible use of these skills contributes to security for everyone.',

    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Cognitive Ew demonstrates key principles from RF warfare. Signals carry information through variations in amplitude, frequency, or phase. Noise and interference degrade signals during transmission. Modulation encodes data onto a carrier wave by varying its amplitude (AM), frequency (FM), or phase (PM). Digital schemes like QAM combine amplitude and phase. Frequency measures oscillation rate in Hertz. In RF, frequency determines propagation characteristics: lower frequencies travel farther, higher frequencies carry more data. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world exploit development?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional exploit development systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use browser hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',

In RF, frequency determines propagation characteristics: lower frequencies travel farther, higher frequencies carry more data.
