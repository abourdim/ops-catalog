The FFT algorithm converts time-domain samples to frequency-domain in O(N·log N) operations. QAM-256 encodes 8 bits per symbol using 256 amplitude/phase combinations. Higher-order modulation increases throughput but requires better SNR. Scanning n ports on m hosts requires n×m probes. Parallelism and timeouts determine scan duration: T = (n×m×timeout)/concurrency.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced exploit development practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',

    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to exploit development. Hardware-based solutions using browser offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with exploit development: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in exploit development.',

    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Drone Hijacker Sim demonstrates key principles from RF warfare. The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into bands allocated by regulators. Spectrum is a finite resource — efficient use is critical for modern communications. Modulation encodes data onto a carrier wave by varying its amplitude (AM), frequency (FM), or phase (PM). Digital schemes like QAM combine amplitude and phase. Scanning probes a system to discover active hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. Active scans send packets; passive scans only listen. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',

The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use browser hardware and may have legal requirements for operation.

    theory: 'Drone Hijacker Sim démontre les principes clés de guerre RF. The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into bands allocated by regulators. Spectrum is a finite resource — efficient use is critical for modern communications. Modulation encodes data onto a carrier wave by varying its amplitude (AM), frequency (FM), or phase (PM). Digital schemes like QAM combine amplitude and phase. Scanning probes a system to discover active hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. Active scans send packets; passive scans only listen. La simulation modélise ces mécanismes à l aide d équations mathématiques dans votre navigateur. Chaque contrôle correspond à un paramètre réel. En expérimentant ici, vous développez l intuition que les professionnels acquièrent après des années d expérience pratique.',
