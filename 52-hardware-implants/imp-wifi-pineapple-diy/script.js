    wiki_history_title: '📜 History of Privacy Tools',
    wiki_history: 'WiFi was released in 1997 as IEEE 802.11 at 2 Mbps. WiFi 6 (802.11ax) now reaches 9.6 Gbps using MU-MIMO and OFDMA. Wifi Pineapple Diy builds on this foundation, letting you explore these historical concepts through interactive simulation.',
    wiki_math_title: '📐 Mathematics Behind Imp Wifi Pineapple Diy',
    wiki_math: 'The mathematics behind Wifi Pineapple Diy: Shannon capacity C = B·log₂(1+SNR) sets the theoretical maximum data rate. WiFi approaches this limit using advanced coding and modulation. Default beacon interval is 102.4 ms (~10 beacons/sec). Each beacon is ~200-300 bytes, consuming ~24 kbps of channel capacity. With 6,000+ relays, path selection uses weighted random choice based on bandwidth. Entry guard selection reduces risk of Sybil attacks from 1/N² to 1/N.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced privacy tools practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',
    wiki_compare_title: '⚖️ Comparing Approaches',
    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to privacy tools. Hardware-based solutions using browser offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with privacy tools: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in privacy tools.',
    wiki_ethics_title: '⚖️ Ethics & Legal Considerations',
    wiki_ethics: 'Privacy Tools carries important ethical and legal responsibilities. Many countries regulate the use of browser and similar equipment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own. Respect privacy laws and data protection regulations. This simulation is designed for educational purposes — it demonstrates principles without transmitting real signals or accessing real networks. Responsible use of these skills contributes to security for everyone.',

    gloss2_term: 'Beacon Interval',
    gloss2_def: 'Time between consecutive beacon transmissions by an access point, typically 100 TU (102.4 ms). Shorter intervals improve discoverability but consume more airtime.',

    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Wifi Pineapple Diy demonstrates key principles from hardware implants. WiFi (802.11) operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. It uses OFDM modulation to transmit data across multiple subcarriers simultaneously. Beacon frames are broadcast by access points ~10 times per second. They announce the network SSID, supported rates, encryption type, and channel. Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymous communication by encrypting traffic through three relays. Each relay only knows the previous and next hop, not the full path. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world privacy tools?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional privacy tools systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use browser hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',

Default beacon interval is 102.4 ms (~10 beacons/sec). Each beacon is ~200-300 bytes, consuming ~24 kbps of channel capacity. With 6,000+ relays, path selection uses weighted random choice based on bandwidth. Entry guard selection reduces risk of Sybil attacks from 1/N² to 1/N.',

    theory: 'Wifi Pineapple Diy يوضح المبادئ الأساسية في الغرسات المادية. WiFi (802.11) operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. It uses OFDM modulation to transmit data across multiple subcarriers simultaneously. Beacon frames are broadcast by access points ~10 times per second. They announce the network SSID, supported rates, encryption type, and channel. Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymous communication by encrypting traffic through three relays. Each relay only knows the previous and next hop, not the full path. تحاكي هذه المحاكاة الآليات الحقيقية باستخدام معادلات رياضية في متصفحك. كل عنصر تحكم يتوافق مع معامل حقيقي. بالتجربة هنا تبني نفس الحدس الذي يطوره المحترفون عبر سنوات من الخبرة العملية.',
