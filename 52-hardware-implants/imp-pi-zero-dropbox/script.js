    wiki_math: 'The mathematics behind Pi Zero Dropbox: Scanning n ports on m hosts requires n×m probes. Parallelism and timeouts determine scan duration: T = (n×m×timeout)/concurrency. With 6,000+ relays, path selection uses weighted random choice based on bandwidth. Entry guard selection reduces risk of Sybil attacks from 1/N² to 1/N. Transmission probability T ≈ e^(-2κL) where κ = √(2m(V₀-E))/ℏ and L is barrier width. Even a 1 nm increase in L can reduce T by orders of magnitude.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced privacy tools practitioners use sophisticated techniques.

These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',

    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to privacy tools. Hardware-based solutions using browser offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with privacy tools: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in privacy tools.',

    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Pi Zero Dropbox demonstrates key principles from hardware implants. Scanning probes a system to discover active hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. Active scans send packets; passive scans only listen. Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymous communication by encrypting traffic through three relays. Each relay only knows the previous and next hop, not the full path. Quantum tunneling allows particles to pass through barriers they classically could not. The probability decreases exponentially with barrier width and height. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world privacy tools?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional privacy tools systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use browser hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',
