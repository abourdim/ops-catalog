    wiki_history_title: '📜 History of Social Engineering',
    wiki_history: 'BLE was introduced in Bluetooth 4.0 (2010) by Nokia. It reduced power consumption by 90% compared to classic Bluetooth, enabling battery-powered sensors. Pretexting Simulator builds on this foundation, letting you explore these historical concepts through interactive simulation.',
    wiki_math_title: '📐 Mathematics Behind Pretexting Simulator',
    wiki_math: 'The mathematics behind Pretexting Simulator: BLE uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation at 1 Mbps. The modulation index of 0.5 provides optimal bandwidth efficiency. Graph analysis reveals social networks: degree centrality identifies influencers, betweenness centrality finds gatekeepers, clustering coefficient measures group cohesion. With 6,000+ relays, path selection uses weighted random choice based on bandwidth. Entry guard selection reduces risk of Sybil attacks from 1/N² to 1/N.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced social engineering practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',
    wiki_compare_title: '⚖️ Comparing Approaches',
    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to social engineering. Hardware-based solutions using browser offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with social engineering: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in social engineering.',
    wiki_ethics_title: '⚖️ Ethics & Legal Considerations',
    wiki_ethics: 'Social Engineering carries important ethical and legal responsibilities. Many countries regulate the use of browser and similar equipment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own. Respect privacy laws and data protection regulations. This simulation is designed for educational purposes — it demonstrates principles without transmitting real signals or accessing real networks. Responsible use of these skills contributes to security for everyone.',
    gloss1_term: 'Advertising Packet',
    gloss1_def: 'A BLE broadcast packet (up to 31 bytes payload) sent on channels 37, 38, 39. Scanners detect these to discover nearby devices without establishing a connection.',
    gloss2_term: 'Metadata',
    gloss2_def: 'Data about data — EXIF in photos (camera, GPS, time), email headers (IP addresses, routing), document properties (author, revision history). Often reveals more than the content itself.',
    gloss3_term: 'Onion Routing',
    gloss3_def: 'Layered encryption where each relay peels one layer. The exit relay sees the destination but not the source. No single relay can link sender to receiver.',
    gloss4_term: 'Latency',
    gloss4_def: 'Time delay between sending and receiving data. Lower latency means faster response. Measured in milliseconds (ms).',
    gloss5_term: 'Throughput',
    gloss5_def: 'Amount of data successfully transmitted per unit time. Measured in bits per second (bps). Affected by bandwidth, protocol overhead, and errors.',
    gloss6_term: 'Protocol',
    gloss6_def: 'A set of rules defining how data is formatted and transmitted. HTTP, TCP, WiFi, and Bluetooth are all protocols with specific rules for communication.',
    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Pretexting Simulator demonstrates key principles from social engineering. Bluetooth Low Energy uses 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It supports advertising (broadcast) and connection (point-to-point) modes. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) gathers information from publicly available sources: social media, public records, websites, DNS records, and metadata. Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymous communication by encrypting traffic through three relays. Each relay only knows the previous and next hop, not the full path. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world social engineering?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional social engineering systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use browser hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',
