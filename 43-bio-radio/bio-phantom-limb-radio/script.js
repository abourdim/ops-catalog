    wiki_history_title: '📜 History of Bioelectronics',
    wiki_history: 'BLE was introduced in Bluetooth 4.0 (2010) by Nokia. It reduced power consumption by 90% compared to classic Bluetooth, enabling battery-powered sensors. Phantom Limb Radio builds on this foundation, letting you explore these historical concepts through interactive simulation.',
    wiki_math_title: '📐 Mathematics Behind Phantom Limb Radio',
    wiki_math: 'The mathematics behind Phantom Limb Radio: BLE uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation at 1 Mbps. The modulation index of 0.5 provides optimal bandwidth efficiency. The Friis transmission equation calculates received power: Pr = Pt·Gt·Gr·(λ/4πd)². Signal strength decreases with the square of distance. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB = 10·log₁₀(Psignal/Pnoise). Every 3 dB increase doubles the signal power relative to noise.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced bioelectronics practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',
    wiki_compare_title: '⚖️ Comparing Approaches',
    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to bioelectronics. Hardware-based solutions using biosensors offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with bioelectronics: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in bioelectronics.',
    wiki_ethics_title: '⚖️ Ethics & Legal Considerations',
    wiki_ethics: 'Bioelectronics carries important ethical and legal responsibilities. Many countries regulate the use of biosensors and similar equipment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own. Respect privacy laws and data protection regulations. This simulation is designed for educational purposes — it demonstrates principles without transmitting real signals or accessing real networks. Responsible use of these skills contributes to security for everyone.',
    gloss1_term: 'Advertising Packet',
    gloss1_def: 'A BLE broadcast packet (up to 31 bytes payload) sent on channels 37, 38, 39. Scanners detect these to discover nearby devices without establishing a connection.',
    gloss2_term: 'Bandwidth',
    gloss2_def: 'The range of frequencies a signal occupies. Wider bandwidth allows more data but requires more spectrum. Measured in Hz (kHz, MHz, GHz).',
    gloss3_term: 'SNR',
    gloss3_def: 'Signal-to-Noise Ratio — the ratio of desired signal power to background noise power. Higher SNR means cleaner signals and lower error rates.',
    gloss4_term: 'Onion Routing',
    gloss4_def: 'Layered encryption where each relay peels one layer. The exit relay sees the destination but not the source. No single relay can link sender to receiver.',
    gloss5_term: 'Latency',
    gloss5_def: 'Time delay between sending and receiving data. Lower latency means faster response. Measured in milliseconds (ms).',
    gloss6_term: 'Throughput',
    gloss6_def: 'Amount of data successfully transmitted per unit time. Measured in bits per second (bps). Affected by bandwidth, protocol overhead, and errors.',
    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Phantom Limb Radio demonstrates key principles from bioelectronics. Bluetooth Low Energy uses 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It supports advertising (broadcast) and connection (point-to-point) modes. Radio waves are electromagnetic radiation between 3 kHz and 300 GHz. They travel at the speed of light and can reflect, refract, and diffract around obstacles. Signals carry information through variations in amplitude, frequency, or phase. Noise and interference degrade signals during transmission. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world bioelectronics?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional bioelectronics systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use biosensors hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',

The modulation index of 0.5 provides optimal bandwidth efficiency. The Friis transmission equation calculates received power: Pr = Pt·Gt·Gr·(λ/4πd)². Signal strength decreases with the square of distance. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB = 10·log₁₀(Psignal/Pnoise). Every 3 dB increase doubles the signal power relative to noise.',

It supports advertising (broadcast) and connection (point-to-point) modes. Radio waves are electromagnetic radiation between 3 kHz and 300 GHz. They travel at the speed of light and can reflect, refract, and diffract around obstacles. Signals carry information through variations in amplitude, frequency, or phase.
