    wiki_history_title: '📜 History of Wifi Security',
    wiki_history: 'The field of WiFi security has evolved significantly over the past century. Early pioneers developed foundational techniques using analog equipment. The digital revolution transformed WiFi security by enabling software-defined approaches. Modern practitioners use tools like WiFi adapter to perform tasks that once required rooms full of equipment. Understanding this history helps you appreciate why certain protocols and standards exist today.',
    wiki_math_title: '📐 Mathematics Behind Evil Twin Spotter',
    wiki_math: 'The mathematics underpinning evil twin spotter involves several key concepts. Signal processing relies on Fourier transforms to convert between time and frequency domains. Information theory (Shannon entropy) determines the theoretical limits of data transmission. Probability and statistics help distinguish real signals from noise. Linear algebra enables matrix operations used in encryption and modulation. Understanding these mathematical foundations lets you predict system behavior before building it.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced WiFi security practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',
    wiki_compare_title: '⚖️ Comparing Approaches',
    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to WiFi security. Hardware-based solutions using WiFi adapter offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with WiFi security: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in WiFi security.',
    wiki_ethics_title: '⚖️ Ethics & Legal Considerations',
    wiki_ethics: 'Wifi Security carries important ethical and legal responsibilities. Many countries regulate the use of WiFi adapter and similar equipment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own. Respect privacy laws and data protection regulations. This simulation is designed for educational purposes — it demonstrates principles without transmitting real signals or accessing real networks. Responsible use of these skills contributes to security for everyone.',

    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Understanding the theory behind evil twin spotter requires grasping several interconnected concepts from WiFi security. At the most fundamental level, this technology works by manipulating signals — whether electromagnetic waves, digital data streams, or sensor readings. The simulation in this app models these real-world phenomena using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every button press and slider adjustment maps to a real parameter that engineers and researchers tune in professional settings. The key principle is that information can be encoded, transmitted, processed, and decoded using well-defined mathematical operations. Fourier analysis breaks complex signals into simple sine waves. Shannon information theory tells us the maximum data rate for any communication channel. Error correction codes add redundancy so messages survive noise and interference. By experimenting with this simulation, you build intuition for these principles — the same intuition that professionals develop over years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world WiFi security?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional WiFi security systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use WiFi adapter hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',
