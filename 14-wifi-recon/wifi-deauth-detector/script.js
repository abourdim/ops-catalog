    wiki_history_title: '📜 History of Wifi Security',
    wiki_history: 'Encryption dates back to ancient Egypt (1900 BCE). The Caesar cipher, Enigma machine, and modern AES represent key milestones in cryptographic evolution. Deauth Detector builds on this foundation, letting you explore these historical concepts through interactive simulation.',
    wiki_math_title: '📐 Mathematics Behind Deauth Detector',
    wiki_math: 'The mathematics behind Deauth Detector: Modern encryption relies on computational hardness: integer factorization (RSA), discrete logarithms (Diffie-Hellman), and elliptic curves (ECC). Shannon capacity C = B·log₂(1+SNR) sets the theoretical maximum data rate. WiFi approaches this limit using advanced coding and modulation. A single deauth frame can disconnect a client for ~1-5 seconds (reassociation time). Sustained attacks at 10 frames/second keep clients permanently disconnected.',
    wiki_advanced_title: '🔬 Advanced Techniques',
    wiki_advanced: 'Beyond the basics demonstrated in this simulation, advanced WiFi security practitioners use sophisticated techniques. Adaptive algorithms automatically adjust parameters based on environmental conditions. Machine learning classifies signals with high accuracy. Multi-channel correlation detects patterns invisible to single-channel analysis. Distributed sensor networks combine data from multiple locations for triangulation. These techniques build on the fundamentals you learn here.',
    wiki_compare_title: '⚖️ Comparing Approaches',
    wiki_compare: 'There are several approaches to WiFi security. Hardware-based solutions using WiFi adapter offer real-time performance and direct signal access. Software simulations (like this app) provide safe experimentation without equipment cost. Cloud-based platforms offer scalability but introduce latency and privacy concerns. Each approach has trade-offs: cost vs. fidelity, speed vs. safety, simplicity vs. capability. This simulation gives you the conceptual foundation to use any approach effectively.',
    wiki_debug_title: '🔧 Troubleshooting Guide',
    wiki_debug: 'Common issues when working with WiFi security: (1) Unexpected results often come from incorrect parameter settings — reset to defaults and change one variable at a time. (2) If the visualization seems frozen, check that the simulation is running (not paused). (3) Noisy or erratic readings usually indicate interference — in real hardware, move away from electronic devices. (4) If calculations seem wrong, verify your units (Hz vs kHz vs MHz). Systematic debugging is a core skill in WiFi security.',
    wiki_ethics_title: '⚖️ Ethics & Legal Considerations',
    wiki_ethics: 'Wifi Security carries important ethical and legal responsibilities. Many countries regulate the use of WiFi adapter and similar equipment. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own. Respect privacy laws and data protection regulations. This simulation is designed for educational purposes — it demonstrates principles without transmitting real signals or accessing real networks. Responsible use of these skills contributes to security for everyone.',

    theoryTitle: '📖 Theory & Background',
    theory: 'Deauth Detector demonstrates key principles from WiFi security. Encryption transforms plaintext into ciphertext using a mathematical algorithm and a key. The strength depends on key length and algorithm choice. WiFi (802.11) operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. It uses OFDM modulation to transmit data across multiple subcarriers simultaneously. Deauthentication frames are management frames in 802.11 that disconnect clients from an access point. They are unprotected in WPA2, enabling DoS attacks. The simulation models these real-world mechanisms using mathematical equations running in your browser. Every control maps to a real parameter that engineers tune in professional settings. By experimenting here, you build the same intuition that professionals develop through years of hands-on experience.',
    faq_q9: 'What common mistakes should I avoid?',
    faq_a9: 'The most common mistake is changing multiple parameters at once, which makes it impossible to understand cause and effect. Always change one thing at a time. Another common error is ignoring the activity log — it records every event and helps you understand the sequence of operations. Finally, do not skip the challenge section: those questions test whether you truly understand the concepts or just memorized the button sequence.',
    faq_q10: 'How does this relate to real-world WiFi security?',
    faq_a10: 'This simulation models the same physics and mathematics used in professional WiFi security systems. The parameters you adjust correspond to real equipment settings. The visualizations show data patterns identical to what you would see on professional instruments like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, or protocol decoders. The main difference is that this runs safely in your browser — real systems use WiFi adapter hardware and may have legal requirements for operation. Skills you develop here transfer directly to hands-on work.',
